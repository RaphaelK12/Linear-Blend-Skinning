//Skeleton Construction:

//Recursive tree-like construction takes much of the pain of this away.

//Joints can have child joints and can be viewed much like nodes. 
//Bones have a (from, to) tuple which specifies the joint they come from and the 
//joint they go to.

//Joints can keep other things, such as their reference orientation (this is a matrix), 
//which is useful when implementing the skinning part. 






// FIXME: create cylinders and lines for the bones
// Hints: Generate a lattice in [-0.5, 0, 0] x [0.5, 1, 0] We wrap this
// around in the vertex shader to produce a very smooth cylinder.  We only
// need to send a small number of points.  Controlling the grid size gives a
// nice wireframe.
